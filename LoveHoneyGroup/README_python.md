### Description of Happy Rabbit Collection

**The main idea:**
>Analysis of Happy Rabbit collection.

**Tasks:**
>Search for patterns in data.
>
>Perform a data visualization.
>
>Interpret the results obtained.

**Data cleaning:**
>Data was analysed. During data pre-processing, data cleaning was made, it included
>
>>valid format assignment;
>>
>>sorting.
>

**Finding patterns by visualizing interesting parameters:**
>Mostly, data cet contains categories instead of numeric features. So standard heatmap was not really useful.
>
>I think that the most interecting correlation may be between type or color of product and the number of sells or price.
>
>The complexity of this analysis is that the data string. So i found 2 types of solution.
>
>>1.date can be converted to category
>>
>>2.using Cramerâ€™s V method.
>
>Undoubtedly, the first option is easier than the second one. Moreover, I had a mistake in correlation betweeen rating and rating when I applied the Cramer's V method.

**Conclusion:**
>The data set is was too small.
>
>As a result of the work, it was noted that the most reviewed type of products - vibrators (more than 88% of all reviews)
>
>Differen accessoires are mostly cheaper than vibrators.
>
>A heat map illustrates the correlation of the numeric parameters about this collection.
>
>The most comlicated thing is analysis of correlation between categories.
>
>There are not strong correlations between pairs "Type x Rating", "Type x Price", "Rating x the number of Reviews (Sells)", "Price x the number of Reviews (Sells)".

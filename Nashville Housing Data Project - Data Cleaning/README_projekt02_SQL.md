## The third project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning and Optomisation

**The main idea:**
>To optimize data: create more convenient recording forms, remove duplicates, merge data, etc.

**Tasks:**
>Analysis of original data.
>
>Data harmonization/
>
>Cleaning and optimisation addresses.

**Analysis of original data:**
>Original data had a lot of data, somewhere we had duplicates, "null" and it needed to clean and to optimize

**Data harmonization:**
>All data should be in the similar format without duplicates.
>For example, Y and N was changed to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field.
>Also duplicates and unused columns were removed.

**Cleaning and optimisation addresses:**
>The address is one of the most important parameter.
>First of all, using a unique user code (ID), filled empty cells with addresses.
>After that, the address was divided for convenience into separate columns: state, city, address (street and house number)

**Conclusion:**
>A lot of information was processed using SQL queries.
>Important information has been saved and optimized for the most convenient data search and sorting.
>All unused, empty and duplicate data have been replaced or deleted.

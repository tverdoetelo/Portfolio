## The second project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### COVID Data Visualisation on Dashboard

**The main idea:**
>find the most important numbers and trends during COVID pandemy and visualise them.

**Tasks:**
>Selection of required data for demonstration.
>
>Creation some visualisations.
>
>Combination of all visualisation materials for dashboard.

**Selection of required data for demonstration:**
>There were selected some global numbers such as total cases, total deaths and death percentage.
>
>Also continental distribution of deaths was selected.
>
>The latest important selected data were the time and country distribution of infected people.
>
>Selected data for each visualization was exported to Excel

**Combination of all visualisation materials for dashboard:**
>For global numbers was created a basic table.
>
>For continental distribution of deaths was created a bar chart.
>
>Information about the time and country distribution of infected people was divided for 2 visualisations:
>>First of them is a map.
>>
>>The second one is a graph, that was improved with some predictions about the number of infected people on the most intresting for me countries.
>>These countries are near each other, so they can affect each other or may have similar patterns.
All visualisations has neiutral character of design to avoid unpleasant emotions of the audience.

**Conclusion:**
>Important parameters describing the COVID pandemiie were selected and calculated using SQL. 
>After that, this data was used for creating Daschboard with Tableau.
>This visualisation may be used to find important patterns that can be evaluated for assessing disease risks, treatment effectiveness, isolation effectiveness, etc.

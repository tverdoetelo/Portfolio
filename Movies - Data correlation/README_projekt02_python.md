## The fourth project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### Finding meaningful parameters for the film industry

**The main idea:**
>Visualization of comparison of different parameters from the film industry.

**Tasks:**
>Search for patterns in data.
>
>Perform a data visualization.
>
>Create a data hypothesis and perform a hypothesis check.
>
>Interpret the results obtained.

**Data cleaning:**
>Data was analysed. During data pre-processing, data cleaning was made, it included
>
>>valid format assignment;
>>
>>deleting empty lines, duplicates & ouliers;
>>
>>sorting & ordering.
>

**Finding patterns by visualizing interesting parameters:**
>The film industry is a business, so like everywhere else, the most interesting parameters are costs and revenues.
>So the scatter plot "budget & gross earning" was created.
>
>But other parameters may be of interest to film lovers, such as viewers' and critics' ratings, duration, or year of release.
>For this reason, other visualizations were also created: scatter plot "scores & gross earning" and correlation heatmap for different parameters (year, score, votes, budget, gross, runtime)

**Conclusion:**
>As a result of the work, it was noted that some parameters correlate with each other.
>
>A heat map illustrates the correlation of the intresting parameters about films.

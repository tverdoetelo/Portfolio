## The first project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### COVID Data Exploration

**The main idea:**
>find the most important numbers and trends during COVID pandemy.

**Tasks:**
>Selection of required data for analysis
>
>Computation of statistically important parameters.
>
>Search for patterns in data.

**Computation of statistically important numbers:**
>After selecting the necessary data, important parameters were calculated such as:
>>Likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country.
>>
>>Percentage of population got covid in your country.
>>
>>Percentage of death.
>
>Also Countries with Highest Death Count per Population waas found.

**Pattern finding:**
>Based on data, some trends between important parametrs were selected:
>>Total Cases vs Population.
>>
>>Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths.
>>
>>Countries with Highest Infection Rate vs Population.
>>
>>Total Population vs Vaccinations.

**Conclusion:**
>Important parameters describing the COVID pandemic were calculated using SQL.
>This data was used to find important patterns that can be evaluated for assessing disease risks, treatment effectiveness, isolation effectiveness, etc.

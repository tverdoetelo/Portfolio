## The sixth project of the analytical bootcamp for Data Analysts:
### Creation a webscrapper

**The main idea:**
>Creation a scrapper from website to receive interesting informstion and notice about significant changes.

**Tasks:**
>Search [interesting product](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1718502702/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=CNHXKCTHT4S8&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q4BJTBL3FeISqAh0xVPR-0xFA5rSmQ2wzH_kdV6K5R-PC1MjD4TksVdjcBPJdATditnxxTQgKWeysM7k4FC7TUJJmz-0v205c915uQL_FdA4HLUo6CYzk4QhqPrtRBkG_cLmUEE4EPIFy9ZHljZT1sLrL16TkrE_38a6D3pR5pT9OUSNoND90QsSoZwFdrlPQN-DT33zs7AphYxj37KS5Pj-ts9yVWt3DM-TomvLzVM.1hInZ5WDCh_m3GMweMfn0qqZg51uvcIo5Z6rh9Tya_U&dib_tag=se&keywords=python+books&qid=1712079436&sprefix=python+books%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1).

>Creation webscrapper.
>
>Notification setting.


**Creation webscrapper:**
>Firstly, it was connected to Website and pulled in data
>
>Then, the data was cleaned up
>
>Also a Timestamp was created for output to track when data was collected
>
>After that, CSV was created with headers and data into the file
>
>At the end, we can combine all of the above code into one function (def check()).
>After that we can run check() after a set time and inputs data into your CSV

**Notification setting:**
> Using this code, we can set notification through mail, if price or rate of interesting product hits below a certain level.

**Conclusion:**
>Result of the work can be useful, for example, to Black Fridays offers, because we can understand if sale real is.

**Practice:**
>A database was provided to the educational organization to work with PostgreSQL in DBeaver.
>
>Various queries were written based on this database, from the simplest (select * from table) to more complex ones with window functions and subqueries.
>
>A new table with a foreign key was also created in this database.

**Conclusion:**
>It was my first experience with PostgreSQL because previously I worked only with MySQL but these systems have differencies.

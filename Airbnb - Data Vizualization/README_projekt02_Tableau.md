**Combination of all visualisation materials for dashboard:**
>A basic table was created with data on the number of accommodations with different numbers of bedrooms.
>
>The next bar chart illustrates how the price changes depending on the number of bedrooms.
>
>Information about the price depending on zipcodes was divided into 2 visualisations:
>>First of them is a map.
>>
>>The second one is a graph.
>
>All visualisations has neutral character of design to avoid unpleasant emotions of viewers.
>
>Moreover, thare was another one graph that shows the information about changing of price over the year. But this information was too big to save it using Tableau Public.

**Conclusion:**
>Important parameters describing the housing in the Seattle, the US were downloaded from official source.
>
>After that, this data was used for creating Daschboard with Tableau Public.
>
>This visualisation may be used to find important patterns for people who want to rent/buy/sell the apartments in this city.
